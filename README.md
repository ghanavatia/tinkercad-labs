## ELEC4050 Lab: Control of a DC Motor

The following repository contains helpful information and resources for the Tinkercad lab of ELEC4050.

### A few notes

a. This is **NOT** a repository that you will upload your work to. Rather, this is a centralized location where general resources will reside.

b. Any sensitive section-specific content will be updated on Brightspace. This respository will not be maintained frequently, and should *not* be the first place you check for deadlines, questions, etc.

### How to use this repository

1. Head over to your class' specific folder by navigating to [**Term**] > [**Section Number**]. This will include section-specific content, most importntly housing the link to where you will complete the lab(s).

2. If you would like to get started in learning Tinkercad, navitate to [tutorial.md](tutorial.md). This will include videos and articles that may be useful to learn how Tinkercad works.

3. For each part(s) of the labs, there may be associated resources (i.e., example code, block diagrams) that may help you as you progress through the lab. They can be found through a combination of either your class' specific folder, or the "General Resources" folder in the current directory.
